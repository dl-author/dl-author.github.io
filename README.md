# DL-Author Site

Site for DL.

I forgot how it was initially create in 2015. I was asked to rehost the site for DL in July of 2018. I had swapped computers and wiped old hard drives. I recovered the site by saving the page with all assets, and then fixing the paths to the assets to work on relative paths.

## Development

Change files as is and use `serve -s .` or another static site server.

## Hosting

Hosted with github pages with custom domain from hoover.

## Deployment

Add your changes in the appropriate places. Images, JS, and CSS in the `static` folder. Reference statics with the relative path `static/file-name`.

When you're ready to deploy, also push your changes to the deploy origin.
